= Object title, name, and classification field handling

The CollectionSpace (CS) data model does not include fields like TMS' classification fields. If a client has data in the TMS Classification fields, we need to determine how to migrate this data into CS.

This decision will depend on a number of things, including:

* how classification and related fields have been used in TMS
* how client wishes this data to behave in CS
* preferences for data entry practices going forward in CS

This page documents:

* the TMS data model for object classification and related fields
* the CS data model for this information
* types of data patterns we've seen and implications for how to handle them
* tradeoffs in different ways of handling this information in CS

NOTE: We discuss title information here because, for some types of collections, objects don't have assigned titles and may be a description of the type of object. In such collections, there is often overlap in the information recorded in title, vs. object name and/or classification.

== Sample TMS data patterns

The table below demonstrates data patterns we have seen in different client data. Hopefully the practices used in a single clients's data will be more homogeneous.

2022.1.2 and 2022.1.3 demonstrate how titles for artifacts without assigned titles may overlap with other fields.

2022.1.1 and 2022.1.3 show use of subclassification, to different levels.

2022.1.2 and 2022.1.4 show objectname and classification values that are nearly identical.

2022.1.6 shows a record where no objectname is assigned, but a classification has been assigned.

2022.1.7 has 2 rows, demonstrating that multiple classifications may be assigned to an object.
