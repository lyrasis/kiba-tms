= Packages mapping options

This page covers broad options for handling migration of "packages" data from TMS. This includes data from the tables:

* Packages
* PackageList
* PackageFolders
* FolderTypes
* PackageFolderXrefs

toc::[]

== Data model/functionality differences

TMS packages map roughly to the CS group procedure. However, TMS has a lot more functionality built around packages than CS currently does around group procedures.

* CS does not allow you to organize group procedures into categories/folders like TMS allows you to organize packages
* CS does not have the concept of a personal or shared group procedure. If you create a group procedure in CS, all users of CS will be able to see (and edit) that group
* CS does not have alert queues that can automatically populate group procedures
* CS does not have an in-app "quick moves" function that interacts with group procedures (though you certainly can use group procedures in several different workflows for updating the location for groups of items) (see CS Trainer for details)
* CS does not let you specify/change the order of items in a group
* CS allows you to assign an object or procedure to a group, but it does not allow you to enter `MainData` or `Notes` about the item's inclusion in the group
* CS does not require you to associate a group procedure with a specific record type. For instance, if you have added 20 objects to a group, you can still add 2 exhibitions to the group as well.
* CS does not have "WebAccess" groups (though you can create online stories/exhibits via the Exhibition procedure if you use the public browswer -- ask CS Trainer for details)
* CS does not have package locking
* I am not entirely clear on the functionality related to the data in `Packages.TemplateRecID` (described in TMS data dictionary as "ID of the item in package (ObjectID in case of tableid=108) to use as template to populate condition line items"), but CS does not have this functionality
* CS does not allow you to designate a display record for a group procedure
* CS allows you to add objects and procedures to a group, but not authority terms.

== Packages that will be omitted from the migration

* Packages with `PackageType` = 2 (e.g. "a special package that stores the list of records last used by a user in a module, maintained by system. Used by the 'Restore Last Session' feature.")
* Packages with `itemcount` = 0
* Packages with associated with TMS tables whose data maps to CS authority records (Constituents, HistEvents, ReferenceMaster, etc.)
* Packages in Recycle Bin, since we do not migrate data flagged/stored for deletion
* Packages in `_` folder (created based on alert queues available for user), since CS does not have alert queues and a group like this would become instantly outdated
* Packages in Move Assistant folder(s)

== Client decision packages

A list of the following types of packages will be provided to the client, for decisions on whether to migrate each package as a group:

* Packages in folders with folder type = "Personal" (if not also in a folder with type "Public")
* Packages in folders with folder type = "Shared" (if not also in a folder with type "Public")
* Packages in folders with folder type = "WebAccess" (if not also in a folder with type "Public")
* Packages not assigned to any folder

== Packages that will migrate by default

* Packages in folders with folder type = "Public" (if not also in one of the omitted folders)
* Packages in "Conservation Project" folder types (if not also in one of the omitted folders)

== Client review/decision worksheet: whether to include packages in migration or not

A report is given to the client that includes:

* Migrateable data on all packages (name, notes, etc)
* Non-migrateable data that may help with decision-making (lastuseddate, etc.)
* `omit` column - gives reason package is omitted from migration, if applicable. Client does not have the option of including these in the migration.
* `migrating` column - Initial values are as follows:
** **n** when package is omitted for non-negotiable reason
** **y** when package will migrate by default
** **blank** client should provide decision (y, n). Any left blank will not migrate

=== Instructions

For rows where `migrating` is blank or `y`, change `migrating` to `y` or `n` to indicate whether each package should be migrated.

Do not change values in columns other than `migrating`.

[TIP]
====
Client may change "y" to "n" in `migrating` if desired, but should not edit rows having a value in `omit`.

Changing `migrating` = "y" to "n" may make sense if you want to do something like:

* not migrate packages owned by staff no longer at your institution (sort/filter on `owner`);
* not migrate packages that haven't been used in the past 2 years (sort/filter on `lastuseddate`)

It may be easier to take the following approach:

* Sort, filter, whatever to mark categories of packages as `migrating` "y" or "n", while ignoring `omit`.
* **At the end, sort by `omit` and change all rows with values in that field to `migrating` = "n"**
====

[WARNING]
====
Any rows having a value in `omit` will be switched back to `migrating` = "n" if client changes `migrating` to "y".

== Client review/decision worksheet: handling of inclusion-in-package details

The CS data model does not allow you to enter `MainData` or `Notes` about an item's inclusion in the group.

Once you have indicated what packages should be included in the migration, your migration specialist will prepare a report of all data in these fields for packages that are included in the migration.

You will be asked to decide how to handle the data. Options include:

1. Drop the data from the migration
2. Move the report to post-migration cleanup tasks to be handled manually once migration is complete
3. Merge the data into a note in the object/procedure included in the group - data can be seen when looking at object, but not when looking at group
4. **Recommended if you want to migrate this data**: Merge the data into the group record - data can be seen when looking at group, but not when looking at object

You may propose other options, and we can discuss the feasibility of implementing them in the migration process.

=== Example of option 3:

Object 81.3 is assigned to package "2023 Objects". In TMS the `MainData` field for this relationship = "81.3", and the `Notes` field = "Not found in Box D"

Here is a potential mapping into the object record:

image::package_rel_data_1.png[1800]
+++&nbsp;+++

Because the `MainData` value exactly matches the object number, we did not repeat it in the annotation note.

If the `MainData` value was "81.3A" and the object number was "81.3" the note could be: "2023 Objects: 81.3A: Not found in Box D"

The Annotation date comes from the `DateEntered` field of the TMS PackageList table, which contains the info on which items are in which packages.

=== Example of option 4:
