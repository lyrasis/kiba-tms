= Loans mapping options

There is one table for Loans in TMS. There are two loan record types in CollectionSpace (CS): Loans In, and Loans Out.

There is a field in the TMS table indicating whether a loan is a loan in. We use this value to split the one table into two separate tables for mapping into CS.

This page shows the options as they apply to Loans In, but they are basically the same for Loans Out records, which are quite similar (with slightly different field names).

NOTE: Status notes derived from `remarks` field will appear last in the status list

NOTE: Controlled status values, names, and dates are **not** extracted from the free-text remarks field

NOTE: By default, the "Status" value for these is "Note" but we can change this to another term, or leave that field blank.
