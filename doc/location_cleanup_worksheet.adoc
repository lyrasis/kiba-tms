= Location cleanup worksheet for TMS-to-CS migration

toc::[]

== Important things re: working with the worksheet
* By default, https://github.com/lyrasis/kiba-tms/blob/main/doc/mapping_options/locations.adoc#populate_storage_loc_type[we do not populate the CS Storage location type field in a migration]. **If you want to to generate values for this field in the migration, let your Migration Specialist know before you begin working in this spreadsheet.** We will re-generate a the worksheet so that it includes the Storage location type field values we are able to derive from your TMS data, and a column for you to provide new values or make corrections.
* **Only edit the following columns:**
** correct_location_name
** correct_authority
** correct_address
* **Do not edit any values in columns not listed above**. If you do so, we may not be able to merge your work back into the migration.
* It is fine to sort/filter the worksheet however you want in order to review and edit your data.
* Feel free to change the order of the columns to support your work.
* **Do not change column names** or we may not be able to merge your work back into the migration.
* **Do not delete any rows**. Adding rows is ok when needed, as explained in examples below.

=== General way this spreadsheet works in the migration
You make changes and additions in the spreadsheet as per the instructions below. You return the completed worksheet to LYRASIS migration staff.

The spreadsheet then becomes another data source in the migration. The `fulllocid` column allows us to match each row up to the original TMS data it came from. Essentially, we use this to create a "just in the migration process" virtual version of your data.

At the beginning of the final phase of the migration, when you send us the final data to migrate into your production CS, we will run the final data through this process, generate the "just in the migration process" version of your data, and re-check it for new duplicates or any other issues. At this point, you may need to complete a smaller version of this spreadsheet to handle any issues introduced by new data in the system.

== Explanation of selected worksheet columns
usage_ct:: Number of object location records this location is used in.
to_review:: Only appears if you have previously completed this worksheet, and are doing a followup review after sending updated data.
location_name:: maps to Display name field of storage location term record
storage_location_authority:: as coded in TMS; more on this below
locationtype:: only included if you are opting to create migrate Storage location type field values in the migration process. See the first item in the "Important things" liist above.
address:: derived from TMS
term_source:: where the term came from in TMS (explained below)
fulllocid:: id for merging changes back into the migration

=== `term_source` values
Locations:: taken from the TMS Locations table
ObjLocations:: If data in your TMS ObjLocations table will be used to generate Storage Location authority terms. See https://github.com/lyrasis/kiba-tms/blob/main/doc/mapping_options/locations.adoc[Locations mapping options] for more information.

== Background, and important things about location authorities in CS that affect this work

Please refer to https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace-migration-explainers/blob/main/docs/location_authority.adoc[Storage Location authority info and decisions].

This document will be referenced in the step details below, as well.

== To-do overview

Please see the details for each step below.

* Let your Migration Specialist know whether you want a location hierarchy built as part of your migration.
* Review/revise `storage_location_authority` value
* Review/revise location names for correctness and consistency, with an eye to shortening them
* Review/revise `address` value
* Review/revise `locationtype` value (if migrating Storage location type field)

== Step details
=== Let your Migration Specialist know whether you want a location hierarchy built as part of your migration

See https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace-migration-explainers/blob/main/docs/location_authority.adoc#do-you-want-a-location-hierarchy[Do you want a location hierarchy?]

If you want a location hierarchy, there will be another location review step after you finalize the location names. We will generate the hierarchy from the names and ask you to review that they have been generated as expected.


=== Review/revise `storage_location_authority` value

The values in the provided spreadsheet came from how things are coded in TMS.

Please take this opportunity to consider:

* Do you want your locations mapped into the Local and Offsite Storage Location authority vocabularies, or do you want them all in the Local Storage Location authority?
* If you want them in the two different authority vocabularies, are the values that came from TMS actually accurate/appropriate for the way this is modeled in CS?

Please read https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace-migration-explainers/blob/main/docs/location_authority.adoc#which-storage-location-authority-vocabulary-should-each-location-term-be-assigned-to[the relevant section of Storage Location authority info and decisions] for more info.

**If you want them all mapped to the Local vocabulary**, you can just let me know that. You don't need to edit the values in the spreadsheet.

**If you want them split into Local and Offsite**, enter the correct value in the `correct_authority` column as necessary.

**If any of them are actually _Organizations_**, you can put `Organization` in the `correct_authority` column. If there is already a constituent recorded in TMS for the organzation, make sure the `location_name` value here exactly matches whatever you have as the `correctname` in the name type cleanup spreadsheet. If not, enter the name type cleanup sheet's `correctname` in the `correct_location_name` column, or a new Organization record will be added.

It is fine to tag locations that don't exist in the names sheet as Organizations, if you do want an additional Organization record to be created.

=== Review/revise location names for consistency, with an eye to shortening them

Please see https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace-migration-explainers/blob/main/docs/location_authority.adoc#review-location-names-for-consistency-with-an-eye-to-shortening-them[this section] for reasoning and examples.

Make any corrections/changes in the `correct_location_name` column.

==== Removing location values
*If the `usage_ct` value for the row is 0* and you want to not migrate a given location into CS, enter "DO NOT MIGRATE" in the `correct_location_name` value in that row.

*If the `usage_ct` value for the row is > 0,* you _can_ put "DO NOT MIGRATE" in the `correct_location_name`. However, in addition to not creating an Storage Location authority for the location, the ObjLocations records using this location will be dropped from the migration. This is because you can't have a Location/Movement/Inventory (LMI) procedure in CS with no location information.

==== Merge multiple different location values into one location

We can merge multiple rows into one location if you make the `correct_location_name` the same in the spreadsheet.

.Before
....
| usage_ct | location_name                                     | correct_location_name | fulllocid |
|----------+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----------|
|        3 | Museum > Curator's office cabinet                 |                       |         2 |
|        1 | Museum > Curator's office cabinet > Top drawer    |                       |         3 |
|        2 | Museum > Curator's office cabinet > Bottom drawer |                       |         4 |
....

The following will cause 6 items to be assigned to `Museum > Curator's office cabinet` location in CS. Separate location authorities for the top and bottom drawer will not be created.

.After
....
| usage_ct | location_name                                     | correct_location_name             | fulllocid |
|----------+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------|
|        3 | Museum > Curator's office cabinet                 |                                   |         2 |
|        1 | Museum > Curator's office cabinet > Top drawer    | Museum > Curator's office cabinet |         3 |
|        2 | Museum > Curator's office cabinet > Bottom drawer | Museum > Curator's office cabinet |         4 |
....

==== Keep location values from being merged into one in CS when they should not

Depending on the source data, it is possible that we could have a situation like the following. These are two separate locations in TMS, but the data we are drawing on does not have anything to differentiate them while creating locations in CS.

.Before
....
| usage_ct | location_name | correct_location_name | fulllocid |
|----------+---------------+-----------------------+-----------|
|       53 | Gallery 23    |                       |         2 |
|       27 | Gallery 23    |                       |         3 |
....

If left this way, you will end up with *one* `Gallery 23` location in CS, with 80 object location records using that one location.

You would need to add something to the `location_names` to differentiate them:

.After
....
| usage_ct | location_name | correct_location_name   | fulllocid |
|----------+---------------+-------------------------+-----------|
|       53 | Gallery 23    | Building 1 > Gallery 23 |         2 |
|       27 | Gallery 23    | Building 2 > Gallery 23 |         3 |
....

NOTE: I expect this situation to be rare. I don't know if TMS allows you to enter data that would result in this situation. If we run into it as a broader pattern, it may be that we need to tweak the migration logic to pull data from additional places.

=== Review/revise `locationtype` value

*This is optional and you will only see this field if you have told your Migration specialist that you wish to include this field in the migration. Please see https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace-migration-explainers/blob/main/docs/location_authority.adoc#storage-location-type-field[Storage location type field] and decide whether you want to include these values in your migration.*

The default `locationtype` values derived by the migration process have been provided.

Add or correct the `locationtype` value in the `correct_locationtype` column.

=== Review/revise `address` value
*This is optional*

*If you don't want address migrated into location authority records,* let your migration specialist know and ignore this column.

*If you do want address migrated into location authority records,* add/correct any info in the `correct_address` column.
