= Location `temptext` mapping worksheet

The `temptext` field appears in the TMS ObjLocations table. It is defined in the TMS data dictionary as: "Additional text information added to a location transaction, often related to specific location information not included in the Location Authority".

In client data, we end up seeing a mix of data recorded in this field. Usually, most of the values look like they should be mapped to a note in the CollectionSpace (CS) Location/Movement/Inventory (LMI, or movement) procedure. However, we often also see sublocation or sublevel values here that probably would be better treated as a separate Storage Location authority term.

This worksheet gives you the opportunity to:

* review the unique `temptext` values in your data, and
* indicate how we should treat these values in your migration

toc::[]

== Options for indicating how we should treat `temptext` values in your migration

=== Option 1: all the same

Let us know to apply one of the <<available-temptext-mappings>> to all of your `temptext` values.

Do not edit and return the spreadsheet to us.

=== Option 2: individual mappings

== Interpreting the worksheet
To create the worksheet, we create a temporary `combinedvalue` field concatenating the values of the `temptext`, `loclevel` and `sublevel` fields for every record in the ObjLocations table.

Then, we deduplicate on the `combinedvalue` field and remove it. `loclevel` gets renamed to `loc3`, and `sublevel` gets renamed to `loc5` to make the levels of the location hierarchy clearer.

The worksheet has one row per _unique_ `temptext`+`loclevel`+`sublevel` value used in your ObjLocations table. The worksheet may have 100 rows, but these 100 `temptext` values may be used in 10,000 different ObjLocations rows.

IMPORTANT: This allows you to make one change in this "migration layer", rather than having to change values in many records either in TMS prior to migration, or CS after.

NOTE: You might see the same `temptext` value multiple times in the worksheet if it has been used in combination with `loclevel` and/or `sublevel` values. This is because, if the `temptext` is to be treated as a sub-location in the migration, we need to know where in the location hierarchy to insert the `temptext` value.

The other data to the right of the `temptext` value is *example data from one row* in which the given `temptext` value is found. It is given to make the review task a bit less abstract, and hopefully make it possible to compare the under-the-hood data we are working with to what you see working in TMS.

== Interpreting the examples below

Example client has requested that ", " be used to separate Storage Location hierarchy levels in location term strings.

All of the examples are made up data based on patterns seen in real client data.

== Available `temptext` mappings

=== :drop
Do not migrate the `temptext` value.

OPTION 1: If you tell us to apply this treatment to all `temptext` values, we will just remove the `temptext` column from the migration processing.

OPTION 2: If you map individual `temptext` values to :drop, those values will not be included in the lookup table

=== :loc2

Creates a new Storage Location authority term by inserting the value (or corrected_value, if given) of `temptext` after the main location value, before any `loclevel/loc3` value.

.:loc2 mapping example
....
| temptext       | mapping | corrected_value | loc1                     | loc3 | loc5 |

....

Given the above mapping and the following data in TMS (first 5 columns), the values in `migratedlocation` will be created as Storage Location terms in CS, and used as the location value in the LMI procedure.

....

The first 4 rows have no `loclevel/loc3` or `sublevel/loc5` value, so our mapping is based only on a `temptext` match. ", Smith Room" is inserted after the main `location` value to create the `migratedlocation`.

The examples 2021.1.5 and 2021.1.6 show the same treatment, but there is a `loclevel/loc3` value. Because both the `temptext` and `loclevel` value match our mapping, ", T19" is inserted after the main `location` values (which may differ).

TIP: If you are concerned about the combination of a given `temptext` values with different location values, we can provide a partially processed version of the ObjLocations table in CSV format that will allow you to identify what main location values a given `temptext` value has been used with.

The last 2 rows do not match anything in the given mapping example, because their `temptext`+`loclevel/loc3`+`sublevel/loc5` values are different. What we'd get in `migratedlocation` would depend on how we mapped additional rows in the mapping worksheet.


=== :loc4

Creates a new Storage Location authority term by inserting the value (or corrected_value, if given) of `temptext` after the main location value, after any `loclevel/loc3` value, but before any `sublevel/loc5` value.

.:loc4 mapping example
....

The examples 2021.1.5 and 2021.1.6 show the same treatment, but there is a `loclevel/loc3` value. Because both the `temptext` and `loclevel` value match our mapping, ", T19" is inserted after the main `location` value (which may differ), and after the `loclevel/loc3` value.

The 2021.1.7 example matches the final row in the example mappings, and shows that the `temptext` value is inserted between `loclevel/loc3` and `sublevel/loc5` values.

The last row does not match anything in the given mapping example, because the `temptext`+`loclevel/loc3`+`sublevel/loc5` value is different. What we'd get in `migratedlocation` would depend on how we mapped additional rows in the mapping worksheet.

The last row matches the final row of our mapping, so now shows the `temptext` value inserted in the `migratedlocation` value.

=== :currentlocationnote

No additional Storage Location authority term is created.

The value of `temptext` (or the provided `corrected_value` if given) is mapped to the current location note field of LMI procedures derived from rows with matching `temptext`+`loclevel/loc3`+`sublevel/loc5` values.

== Important things re: working with the worksheet

Make sure to follow these instructions if you are
* **Only enter/change data in the following columns**
** `mapping`
** `corrected_value`
* **Do not change column names** or we may not be able to merge your work back into the migration.
* **Do not add or delete any rows**
* It is fine to sort/filter the worksheet however you want in order to review and edit your data.
* Feel free to change the order of the columns to support your work.

If you find issues that cannot be cleaned up/fixed via this spreadsheet, you will need to fix them either in TMS prior to providing final data for production migration, or in CS after the production migration.

=== General way this spreadsheet works in the migration
You make changes and additions in the spreadsheet as per the instructions below. You return the completed worksheet to LYRASIS migration staff.

The spreadsheet then becomes another data source in the migration. The `fulllocid` column allows us to match each row up to the original TMS data it came from. Essentially, we use this to create a "just in the migration process" virtual version of your data.

At the beginning of the final phase of the migration, when you send us the final data to migrate into your production CS, we will run the final data through this process, generate the "just in the migration process" version of your data, and re-check it for new duplicates or any other issues. At this point, you may need to complete a smaller version of this spreadsheet to handle any issues introduced by new data in the system.
