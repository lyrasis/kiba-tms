= Location `temptext` mapping worksheet

The `temptext` field appears in the TMS ObjLocations table. It is defined in the TMS data dictionary as: "Additional text information added to a location transaction, often related to specific location information not included in the Location Authority".

In client data, we end up seeing a mix of data recorded in this field. Usually, most of the values look like they should be mapped to a note in the CollectionSpace (CS) Location/Movement/Inventory (LMI, or movement) procedure. However, we often also see sublocation or sublevel values here that probably would be better treated as a separate Storage Location authority term.

This worksheet gives you the opportunity to:

* review the unique `temptext` values in your data, and
* indicate how we should treat these values in your migration

toc::[]

== Options for indicating how we should treat `temptext` values in your migration

=== Option 1: all the same

Let us know to apply one of the <<available-temptext-mappings>> to all of your `temptext` values.

Do not edit and return the spreadsheet to us.

You cannot make corrections to `temptext` values with this option.

=== Option 2: individual mappings

This option lets you specify different <<available-temptext-mappings,`temptext` treatment mappings>> per `temptext` value.

It also lets you make corrections to the content of `temptext` values.

Make sure to follow the <<instructions-for-editing-the-worksheet>>.

Let your Migration Specialist know if you have any questions in the process.

== Interpreting the worksheet
Prior to preparing the worksheet, your Migration Specialist has analyzed your ObjLocations table data. You will only be asked to complete this worksheet if there are `temptext` values to review.

They will also look at the other, more structured fields potentially containing location hierarchy information, and configure your migration to include only those having data. See the table under xref:mapping_options/locations.adoc#tms-location-fields-and-hierarchy-levels[Locations mapping options: TMS location fields and hierarchy levels] for details on these fields. Any of these fields in your ObjLocation data will be renamed to reflect its hierarchy level. For example, if you have `loclevel` data, that field is renamed `loc6`. The remainder of this section refers to these fields as *_sublevel fields_*.

To create the worksheet, we create a temporary `combinedvalue` field concatenating the values of the `temptext` and any sublevel fields for every record in the ObjLocations table.

Then, we deduplicate on the `combinedvalue` field and remove it.

The worksheet has one row per _unique_ `temptext`+`sublevel fields` value used in your ObjLocations table. The worksheet may have 100 rows, but these 100 `temptext` values may be used in 10,000 different ObjLocations rows.

IMPORTANT: This allows you to make one change in this "migration layer", rather than having to change values in many records either in TMS prior to migration, or CS after.

NOTE: You might see the same `temptext` value multiple times in the worksheet if it has been used in combination with different sublevel field values. This is because, if the `temptext` is to be treated as a sub-location in the migration, we need to know where in the location hierarchy to insert the `temptext` value.

The other data to the right of the `temptext` value is *example data from one row* in which the given `temptext` value is found. It is given to make the review task a bit less abstract, and hopefully make it possible to compare the under-the-hood data we are working with to what you see working in TMS.

== Interpreting the examples below

Example client's migration has the following configuration settings:

* Tms::Locations.hierarchy_delim = ", "
* Tms::ObjLocations.fulllocid_fields = %i[loclevel sublevel]
* Tms::ObjLocations.sublevel_lvl = :loc9


All of the examples are made up data based on patterns seen in real client data.

== Available `temptext` mappings

=== :drop
Do not migrate the `temptext` value.

OPTION 1: If you tell us to apply this treatment to all `temptext` values, we will just remove the `temptext` column from the migration processing.

OPTION 2: If you map individual `temptext` values to :drop, those values will not be included in the lookup table

=== :loc5

Creates a new Storage Location authority term by inserting the value (or corrected_value, if given) of `temptext` after the main location value, before any `loclevel/loc6` value.

.:loc5 mapping example
....
| temptext       | mapping | corrected_value | loc1                     | loc6 | loc9 |

....

Given the above mapping and the following data in TMS (first 5 columns), the values in `migratedlocation` will be created as Storage Location terms in CS, and used as the location value in the LMI procedure.

....

The first 4 rows have no `loclevel/loc6` or `sublevel/loc9` value, so our mapping is based only on a `temptext` match. ", Smith Room" is inserted after the main `location` value to create the `migratedlocation`.

The examples 2021.1.5 and 2021.1.6 show the same treatment, but there is a `loclevel/loc6` value. Because both the `temptext` and `loclevel` value match our mapping, ", T19" is inserted after the main `location` values (which may differ).

TIP: If you are concerned about the combination of a given `temptext` values with different location values, we can provide a partially processed version of the ObjLocations table in CSV format that will allow you to identify what main location values a given `temptext` value has been used with.

The last 2 rows do not match anything in the given mapping example, because their `temptext`+`loclevel/loc6`+`sublevel/loc9` values are different. What we'd get in `migratedlocation` would depend on how we mapped additional rows in the mapping worksheet.


=== :loc7

Creates a new Storage Location authority term by inserting the value (or corrected_value, if given) of `temptext` after the main location value, after any `loclevel/loc6` value, but before any `sublevel/loc5` value.

.:loc7 mapping example
....

The examples 2021.1.5 and 2021.1.6 show the same treatment, but there is a `loclevel/loc6` value. Because both the `temptext` and `loclevel` value match our mapping, ", T19" is inserted after the main `location` value (which may differ), and after the `loclevel/loc6` value.

The 2021.1.7 example matches the final row in the example mappings, and shows that the `temptext` value is inserted between `loclevel/loc6` and `sublevel/loc9` values.

The last row does not match anything in the given mapping example, because the `temptext`+`loclevel/loc6`+`sublevel/loc9` value is different. What we'd get in `migratedlocation` would depend on how we mapped additional rows in the mapping worksheet.

=== :loc10

Creates a new Storage Location authority term by inserting the value (or corrected_value, if given) of `temptext` after the main location value, and after any `loclevel/loc6` or `sublevel/loc9` values.

The last row matches the final row of our mapping, so now shows the `temptext` value inserted in the `migratedlocation` value.

=== :currentlocationnote

No additional Storage Location authority term is created.

The value of `temptext` (or the provided `corrected_value` if given) is mapped to the current location note field of LMI procedures derived from rows with matching `temptext`+`loclevel/loc6`+`sublevel/loc9` values.

== Instructions for editing the worksheet

* **Only enter/change data in the following columns**
** `mapping`
** `corrected_value`
* **Do not change column names** or we may not be able to merge your work back into the migration.
* **Do not add or delete any rows**
* It is fine to sort/filter the worksheet however you want in order to review and edit your data.
* Feel free to change the order of the columns to support your work.

If you find issues that cannot be cleaned up/fixed via this spreadsheet, you will need to fix them either in TMS prior to providing final data for production migration, or in CS after the production migration.
