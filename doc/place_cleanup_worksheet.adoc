= Place cleanup worksheet

toc::[]

== Background/rationale

To prepare place data from TMS into usable authority terms for ingest into CS Place authority.

=== How this data will end up going into CS

Your migration specialist will have initially identified which fields in your data should be treated as hierarchical in this process (i.e. `hierarchy_fields`). Values in `hierarchy_fields` will be combined into a single string term in CS (e.g. "North Carolina < United States").

Each unique value from other fields will be treated as a standalone term in CS. For example, if your `hierarchy_fields` include `continent`, `country`, `state`, and `city`, and you have the following data in a row:

....
| continent | country       | state          | city    | region   | building         |
|-----------+---------------+----------------+---------+----------+------------------|
|           | United States | North Carolina | Raleigh | Downtown | Capitol Building |
....

You will end up with 3 place authority terms in CS:

* Raleigh < North Carolina < United States
* Downtown
* Capitol Building


== Completing the worksheet

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do **not** make changes to the following columns:

* `norm_combineds`
* `norm_fingerprints`
* `clean_fingerprint`
* `clean_combined`

**If you change values in these fields, we will not be able to merge your changes back into the migration.**
====

You can edit any other fields as you wish. You can also:

* Re-order columns (useful if you want to make changes to what fields are included in `hierarchy_fields` setting, or the order in which they are combined);
* Sort and filter the spreadsheet; and
* Change the formula in the `value_from_hierarchy` field (if you are changing `hierarchy_fields` and their order)

=== Understanding the worksheet

* From left-to-right, the first columns are your `hierarchy_fields` columns, organized from broader-to-narrower (Though these will be combined narrower-to-broader to create the place authority terms, so that the most specfic part of the term is always visible in your CS records)
* These are followed by the TMS place fields that aren't included in `hierarchy_fields`
* These are followed by 4 blank fields (in your initial worksheet iteration) whose use will be covered in the examples:
** `uncontrolled_value`
** `proximity_note`
** `uncertainty_note`
** `place_note`
* `value_from_hierarchy` - auto-populated via formula from your `hierarchy_fields`, so you can sort/filter to see the effect of your work on the eventual hierarchy terms.
** The pivot table in the `hierarchysummary` tab shows you all unique combined values in this field. You will need to right click in the table > Refresh after making changes in the `data` tab
* `occurrences`- number of times the place data represented by this row gets used elsewhere in your data. You may want to focus your work more on terms that are used a lot, or determine a "preferred" form to used based on usage in your data

The remaining fields are for managing the iterative cleanup workflow and data merging back into the migration.

=== Iterative cleanup process

TMS has a lot of place-related fields, and often there are a lot of rows in this worksheet to deal with.

It can be useful to do the work in stages. Each time you return a copy of the worksheet to your migration specialist, they can prepare a new version with your corrections merged in, and fewer rows to deal with.

For example, if you receive a worksheet with:

....
| continent     | country       | state          | city    | township |
|---------------+---------------+----------------+---------+----------|
| North America | United States | NC             |         |          |
|               | USA           | NC             |         |          |
|               |               | North Carolina |         |          |
|               |               | North Carolina | Raleigh |          |
|               | US            | NC             |         | Raleigh  |
....

And return that worksheet with the following changes:

....
| continent     | country       | state          | city    | township |
|---------------+---------------+----------------+---------+----------|
| North America | United States | North Carolina |         |          |
| North America | United States | North Carolina |         |          |
| North America | United States | North Carolina |         |          |
| North America | United States | North Carolina | Raleigh |          |
| North America | United States | North Carolina | Raleigh |          |
....

The next worksheet you receive will collapse all those rows to:

....
| continent     | country       | state          | city    | township |
|---------------+---------------+----------------+---------+----------|
| North America | United States | North Carolina |         |          |
| North America | United States | North Carolina | Raleigh |          |
....

If you work to make things more consistent starting with the hierarchy fields, broader-to-narrower, then you can substantially reduce the number of rows/values you are dealing with in the next iteration of the worksheet.

WARNING: Once you have returned a version of the worksheet to your migration specialist, *do not* do any additional work in that version. There will be no way to merge your additional work into the new version of the worksheet your migration specialist will be preparing.

=== Suggested general approach

It would be appropriate to return the worksheet for a new iteration after completing each step.

* Fill out the levels of your hierarchy consistently and make the terms used in each level consistent (US vs USA vs United States)
* Examine non-hierarchy fields for terms entered in the wrong field (California in `county`, for example). Move values to the correct fields
* Once non-hierarchy field values have been correctly categorized, can you add any more fields into your hierarchy?

[TIP]
.Experiment with hierarchy in spreadsheet
====
Say your initial `hierarchy_fields` include `continent`, `country`, `state`, and `city`

These are columns A, B, C, and D in your worksheet, respectively.

Remembering that term concatenation is done narrower-to-broader, the formula in row 2's `value_from_hierarchy` column is:

`=TEXTJOIN(" < ",TRUE,D2,C2,B2,A2)`

If you have cleaned up the `county` column (H) and want to see what the effect of adding it in the hierarchy would be, you can change the formula to add it between `state` and `city`:

`=TEXTJOIN(" < ",TRUE,D2,H2,C2,B2,A2)`

If you like what you see in the `value_from_hierarchy` column (and after refreshing table on `hierarchysummary` tab after doing that, you can return the worksheet to your migration specialist and ask them to add `county` between `state` and `city`.

They will generate a new version of the worksheet and supporting report that incorporates `county` into hierarchy.
====

* Make sure terms that will be coming from non-hierarchy fields are contextualized to avoid unwanted collapse of separate places into one term.

(examples on this and use of accompanying report todo)

* Separate out any proximity or uncertainty info from terms missed or impossible to handle in the normalization process
* Do any values belong treated as general notes in the records where they are used, instead of as authority terms? (generally objects and/or persons/organizations---your migration specialist can tell you which are relevant for your project)

== About the accompanying cleaned_exploded_report

=== Purpose/connection to place cleanup worksheet

The purpose of this report is to serve as a reference and alternate way to explore your place data for cleanup.

WARNING: Do not do cleanup in this report, as we cannot merge changes from this report back into the migration.

Each row in this report has a `clean_combined` value, which can be used to find the matching row in the place cleanup worksheet.

=== Source data

* Based on TMS base data with all returned cleanup to the current point in time merged in. The source data for this report has one row per unique `clean_combined` value.
* This source data is "exploded" to create one row per field value. So if `clean_combined` is "country: USA|||state: New Mexico|||city: Zuni", 3 rows are created.

=== Columns

==== `key`

Concatenation of `value`+ `fieldname`. May be useful for sorting or pivot table summary/analysis.

==== `value`

The field value kept when original source row was exploded. For instance, if `clean_combined` is "country: USA|||state: New Mexico|||city: Zuni" the `value` in the three rows will be "USA", "New Mexico", and "Zuni".

==== `fieldname`

Name of field in which `value` was recorded.

==== `field_cat`
Whether the given value is used only in a single field, or is used in multiple fields.

single field:: when the value is only used in one field, for example if "Adams" is only recorded as a city:

....
| value | fieldname | field_cat    |
|-------+-----------+--------------|
| Adams | city      | single field |
| Adams | city      | single field |
....

multi field:: when the value is used in more than one field, for example if "Durham" is recorded in both county and city:

....
| value  | fieldname | field_cat   |
|--------+-----------+-------------|
| Durham | city      | multi field |
| Durham | county    | multi field |
....

or

....
| value      | fieldname | field_cat   |
|------------+-----------+-------------|
| California | county    | multi field |
| California | country   | multi field |
| California | state     | multi field |
....


[TIP]
.Multi field does not necessarily indicate a problem
====
In North Carolina, the city of Durham is located in Durham County. When identical place names are actually used to represent different levels of place-ness, you probably want to add something to at least one of the values to distinguish it. For example:

....
| value      | fieldname | field_cat   |
|------------+-----------+-------------|
| Durham     | city      | multi field |
| Durham Co. | county    | multi field |
....

That said, the California example shows that multi field can highlight issues where values have been recorded in the wrong field and should be cleaned up
====

==== `left_cat`

Whether the leftward, or broader, information for a value/field key is consistent (i.e. single broader) or varies (multi broader).

Multi broader value/field keys indicate places where the hierarchy may be inconsistently provided or recorded, or where places need to be disambiguated.

.`key` = "Albany|||city"
....
| value  | fieldname | field_cat    | left_cat      | left_combined                                         |
|--------+-----------+--------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| Albany | city      | single field | multi broader | country: USA|||state: California                      |
| Albany | city      | single field | multi broader | country: USA|||state: Georgia                         |
| Albany | city      | single field | multi broader | country: USA|||state: New York                        |
| Albany | city      | single field | multi broader | country: USA|||state: Ohio                            |
| Albany | city      | single field | multi broader | country: United States of America|||state: California |
| Albany | city      | single field | multi broader | state: Georgia                                        |
| Albany | city      | single field | multi broader | state: Indiana                                        |
....

By cleaning up the following in the associated rows in the cleanup worksheet:

* Row 5: change country to "USA"
* Row 6 and 7: add "USA" in country field

You will end up with consistent, clearly disambiguated terms for the different Albanys.

.`key` = "Algeria|||country"
....
| value   | fieldname | field_cat    | left_cat       | left_combined |
|---------+-----------+--------------+----------------+---------------|
| Algeria | country   | single field | single broader | (top)         |
| Algeria | country   | single field | single broader | (top)         |
| Algeria | country   | single field | single broader | (top)         |
| Algeria | country   | single field | single broader | (top)         |

....

"Algeria" is only ever recorded as the broadest term level.

.single broader?
....
| value      | fieldname | field_cat   | left_cat       | left_combined                    |
|------------+-----------+-------------+----------------+----------------------------------|
| Alfajayuca | city      | multi field | single broader | country: Mexico|||state: Hidalgo |
| Alfajayuca | region    | multi field | single broader | (single)                         |
....

One value has country and state broader values. The other was recorded in region field with no other fields populated. Why do these show up as `single broader`?

Because this categorization is done on value/fieldname key. Alfajayuca as a city only ever has one broader pattern. Alfajayuca as a region is only ever recorded as the only field value in its row.

==== `left_combined`

There are two special values:

(single):: Indicates there is only this value in the row, so leftward value would always be empty.
(top):: Indicates that there is more than one value for the row, but this value occupies the broadest/leftmost position


Otherwise, the value here is the actual leftward/broader values for each row, concatenated broader-to-narrower.

NOTE: The order of the fields in `left_combined` is determined as follows: `hierarchy_fields` from broader to narrower, followed by non-hierarchy data fields from left-to-right as the fields appear in the original source data.

[TIP]
====
Sorting on `left_combined` may be a useful strategy for identifying places where hierarchy can be made more consistent.

.Consistent - cities are recorded under Algeria (country)
....
| value    | fieldname | field_cat    | left_cat       | left_combined    |
|----------+-----------+--------------+----------------+------------------|
| El Goléa | city      | single field | single broader | country: Algeria |
| Ghardaïa | city      | single field | single broader | country: Algeria |
| Ouargla  | city      | single field | single broader | country: Algeria |
| Luanda   | city      | single field | single broader | country: Angola  |
....

.Inconsistent - perhaps add a `state` value for Jindabyne?
....
| value           | fieldname | field_cat    | left_cat       | left_combined      |
|-----------------+-----------+--------------+----------------+--------------------|
| Jindabyne       | city      | single field | single broader | country: Australia |
| New South Wales | state     | single field | single broader | country: Australia |
| Tasmania        | state     | single field | single broader | country: Australia |
| Victoria        | state     | multi field  | single broader | country: Australia |
....
====

==== `clean_combined`

The full `clean_combined` value. This will match up with the `clean_combined` value in your places cleanup worksheet.

==== `occs`

Number of times the value is used/mapped to a field in a record in your data.

==== `objectnumbers`, `objecttitles`, `objectdescriptions`

Example values from object records that values will be merged into. This information can be helpful in situations like this:

....
| value | fieldname | field_cat    | left_cat         | left_combined                       | clean_combined                                    | occs | objectnumbers | objecttitles                                          |
|-------+-----------+--------------+------------------+-------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| Adams | city      | single field | multiple broader | (single)                            | city: Adams                                       |    1 |             1 | AMANZAMTOTO, SOUTH AFRICA (NOW CALLED ADAMS)..., 1898 |
| Adams | city      | single field | multiple broader | country: USA|||state: Massachusetts | country: USA|||state: Massachusetts|||city: Adams |    1 |            38 | ADAMS, MASSACHUSETTS, 1992                            |
....

We can determine from this data that the initial "Adams" is a different place from the second.

== Examples for different situations

TIP: If you have a situation not shown below, please ask how to handle it and we'll add an example!

=== Use of `uncontrolled_value` field

Use to record value(s) that are not related to the place name, and which does not need to be kept with the place information in order to make sense.

Fairly rarely needed.

.Original
....
| continent | country | city      | locale                                  | uncontrolled_value |
|-----------+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+--------------------|
| Europe    | Wales   | Laugharne | Brown's Hotel, reproduction at 1/2 size |                    |
....

.Cleaned
....
| continent | country | city      | locale        | uncontrolled_value                     |
|-----------+---------+-----------+---------------+----------------------------------------|
| Europe    | Wales   | Laugharne | Brown's Hotel | 1/2 size reproduction of Brown's Hotel |
....

If your `hierarchy_fields` do not contain `locale`, place authority terms created for:

* Laugharne < Wales < Europe
* Brown's Hotel

If your `hierarchy_fields` does contain `locale`, place authority term created for:

* Brown's Hotel < Laugharne < Wales < Europe

Either way, "reproduction at 1/2 size" is not included in the place data. The slightly edited version entered in `uncontrolled_value` will be mapped into a rarely-used note field in any object records linked to the `orig_combined` value(s) associated with this row. A post-migration cleanup task will be created to remind you to check records with the rarely-used note field populated and manually figure out to do with this information once the migration is complete. The note in `uncontrolled_value` was edited to capture some of the context of the place it referred to, since the note value will be separated from any info about places in the record.

=== Use of `proximity_note` field

Your chance to manually fix any proximity information that wasn't separated out programmatically in the normalization process.

.Original
....
| continent | country | city                         | locale               | proxmity_note |
|-----------+---------+------------------------------+----------------------+---------------|
| Europe    | Wales   | down the road from Laugharne | next to Gray's Hotel |               |
....

.Cleaned
....
| continent | country | city      | locale       | proxmity_note                                      |
|-----------+---------+-----------+--------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| Europe    | Wales   | Laugharne | Gray's Hotel | down the road from Laugharne; next to Gray's Hotel |
....

If your `hierarchy_fields` do not contain `locale`, place authority terms created for:

* Laugharne < Wales < Europe
* Gray's Hotel

If your `hierarchy_fields` does contain `locale`, place authority term created for:

* Gray's Hotel < Laugharne < Wales < Europe

If your CS domain profile and mapping decisions permit, the value of `proximity_note` will be included as a note associated with any place values used in objects linked to the `orig_combined` value(s) associated with this row. This does mean that if your `hierarchy_fields` do not contain `locale`, the same proximity note will appear next to both terms merged in from this row.

If your CS domain profile and mapping decisions do not permit, the value of `proximity_note` will be dropped.

=== Use of `uncertainty_note` field

Your chance to manually fix any uncertainty information that wasn't separated out programmatically in the normalization process.

.Original
....
| continent | country | city      | locale             | uncertainty_note |
|-----------+---------+-----------+--------------------+------------------|
| Europe    | Wales   | Laugharne | maybe Blue's Hotel |                  |
....

.Cleaned
....
| continent | country | city      | locale       | uncertainty_note |
|-----------+---------+-----------+--------------+------------------|
| Europe    | Wales   | Laugharne | Blue's Hotel | maybe            |
....

If your `hierarchy_fields` do not contain `locale`, place authority terms created for:

* Laugharne < Wales < Europe
* Blue's Hotel

If your `hierarchy_fields` does contain `locale`, place authority term created for:

* Blue's Hotel < Laugharne < Wales < Europe

If your CS domain profile and mapping decisions permit, the value of `uncertainty_note` will be included as a note associated with any place values used in objects linked to the `orig_combined` value(s) associated with this row. This does mean that if your `hierarchy_fields` do not contain `locale`, the same uncertainty note will appear next to both terms merged in from this row.

If your CS domain profile and mapping decisions do not permit, the value of `uncertainty_note` will be dropped.

=== Use of `place_note` field

Use to remove all/part of a value from data that will be used to create the controlled place term, but keep it in a note that will be associated with the place term. Contrast this from the `uncontrolled_value` field, where the note gets separated from the place term.

.Original
....
| continent | country | city      | locale                                  | place_note |
|-----------+---------+-----------+-----------------------------------------+------------|
| Europe    | Wales   | Laugharne | Brown's Hotel, reproduction at 1/2 size |            |
....

.Cleaned
....
| continent | country | city      | locale        | place_note            |
|-----------+---------+-----------+---------------+-----------------------|
| Europe    | Wales   | Laugharne | Brown's Hotel | 1/2 size reproduction |
....

If your `hierarchy_fields` do not contain `locale`, place authority terms created for:

* Laugharne < Wales < Europe
* Brown's Hotel

If your `hierarchy_fields` does contain `locale`, place authority term created for:

* Brown's Hotel < Laugharne < Wales < Europe

If your CS domain profile and mapping decisions permit, the value of `place_note` will be included as a note associated with any place values used in objects linked to the `orig_combined` value(s) associated with this row.

If your `hierarchy_fields` do not contain `locale`, the result will be:

* Laugharne < Wales < Europe (with "1/2 size reproduction" note with the use of that place term)
* Brown's Hotel (with "1/2 size reproduction" note with the use of that place term)

In this situation, it may be best to use the `uncontrolled_value` field, to manually put the note in the proper place, post-migration.

If your CS domain profile and mapping decisions do not permit, the value of `uncertainty_note` will be dropped.


== Things we cannot handle via this process

=== Associating variant forms of place name with main term

For more on variant terms in CS, see: https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace-data-explainers/blob/main/docs/authority_main_variant_term_functionality.adoc[Authority main and variant term functionality]. (Note that in a Lyrasis-hosted CS instance you will not be able to select/use variant forms in your records)

The purpose of this cleanup is to establish the *main terms* that will be created in the Place authority.

There's no feasible way to add in recording variant forms, given that:

* the values of multiple `hierarchy_fields` are combined into one main term; and
* values from multiple other fields in the same row may become separate main terms

.Original
....
| state          | city                       |
|----------------+----------------------------|
| North Carolina | Stem                       |
| North Carolina | Tally-ho (i.e. Stem)       |
| North Carolina | Stem (previously Tally-ho) |
| North Carolina | Tally-ho                   |
....

Most clients will likely want to change this to:

....
| state          | city | value_from_hierarchy  |
|----------------+------+-----------------------|
| North Carolina | Stem | Stem < North Carolina |
| North Carolina | Stem | Stem < North Carolina |
| North Carolina | Stem | Stem < North Carolina |
| North Carolina | Stem | Stem < North Carolina |
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
Keep a list of variant terms you want to associate with main terms, because we will be able to merge these in once you have finalized your main terms.

For example:

....
| main term               | variant term              | type             | historical_status | language |
|-------------------------+---------------------------+------------------+-------------------+----------|
| Stem < North Carolina   | Tally-ho < North Carolina |                  | historical        |          |
| Stem < North Carolina   | Tallyho < North Carolina  | spelling variant | historical        |          |
| United States           | États-Unis                |                  |                   | French   |
| Devil's Tramping Ground | Devil's Stomping Ground   |                  |                   |          |
....

Note that, for main terms derived from a combination of hierarchy terms, we need the whole combined term as the main term.

For a term like "Devil's Tramping Ground", recorded in non-hierarchy field `locus`, we just need the value in `locus` as the main term.

It's up to you if you want to keep track of things like `type`, `historical status`, and `language`.

Check out the fields in the Place authority term box.

image::place_term_field_group.png[2274]
+++&nbsp;+++

Each variant term will create an additional iteration of this term box, and we can map associated values to fields in the term box, if you provide them consistently and tell us how to map them.
====

=== Splitting a given field value into multiple main terms

There's currently no feasible way to turn something like this:

....
| country       | state          | city               |
|---------------+----------------+--------------------|
| United States | North Carolina | Raleigh and Durham |
....

into two main terms in CS:

* Raleigh < North Carolina < United States
* Durham < North Carolina < United States

Keep track of any you run into like this, and discuss options with your migration specialist once you have otherwise finalized your main terms.
