= Alternate number types for objects worksheet

toc::[]

== Background/rationale

Due to differences in how TMS and CollectionSpace (CS) model alternate number data for objects, cleanup of alternate number descriptions is often necessary for a migration.

=== Data model differences
==== TMS

From our experience analyzing client data, it appears that TMS allows you to enter:

* an alternate number value (or not, sometimes the `altnum` field is empty!)
* free text alternate number description (optional)
* free text remarks on alternate number (optional)
* start and end dates for the use of the number (or its assignment/removal)

There appears to be no controlled vocabulary for types of alternate numbers.

There appears to be no data validation/checks. For example, we often find that users have entered the description in the `altnum` field and the number in the `description` field. This is common enough that we know to look for this pattern and flip the values.

==== CollectionSpace (CS)

Depending on your data and your needs, you might opt to use one of the mapping approaches described below, OR you might combine some or all of the approaches.

This worksheet allows you to specify which of the following treatments should be used for each of your alt number types in TMS.

===== Other number field group

This is the typical, obvious mapping for object AltNum data, however, the data model is much simpler and much more constrained than TMS'.

+++&nbsp;+++

* The other number _value_ is free text
* The other number _type_ is field is populated from a controlled vocabulary
* The `numberType` controlled vocabulary is an https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace-data-explainers/blob/main/docs/controlled_vocabulary_types.adoc#option-lists[option list], intended for relatively short lists of terms that do not change often

This is the preferred mapping for most clients.

===== Alternative mapping: Annotation field group with controlled number type terms

This approach may work better if you:
* have a large number of alt number types in TMS (i.e. unique AltNums.description field values)
* need to be able to add new number types without waiting for Lyrasis staff to make, review, and deploy UI configuration code changes
* have remarks and/or date information associated with alternate numbers

.Authorized staff manage number type terms in Annotation Types https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace-data-explainers/blob/main/docs/controlled_vocabulary_types.adoc#term-lists[term list]
image::term_list_annotation_type.png[348]
+++&nbsp;+++

The "numtype: " prefix is added so that annotation terms for number types are grouped together for term management. Also, during data entry in your Object records, this limits term options to just number types if you start typing "numtype". This prefix is optional and can be changed to another string or omitted.

.In Object record, alternate number value(s) recorded as Annotations

+++&nbsp;+++

This allows for precise advanced search queries on alternate number values, by type:

.In Object record, alternate number value(s) recorded as Annotations

+++&nbsp;+++

NOTE: Only one calendar date can be recorded as Annotation date, so that field cannot be used to record start/end dates for alternate numbers. If start/end dates are present in the TMS data, they are converted to text and concatenated to the Annotation note value.

===== Alternative mapping: Annotation field group with uncontrolled number types

In this option, `alternate number` is added as an annotation type term.

All alternate numbers recorded as annotations are assigned this Annotation type.

The alternate number itself, its description, remarks, and any begin/end date info are all concatenated into the Annotation note field:

== Interpreting the worksheet

TIP: For reference, your Migration Specialist will also provide you with a spreadsheet that shows all individual AltNums rows, so that you can look at the details of what is being summarized in the worksheet.

.Non-editable columns
`number_type`:: This is the value of the `description` column in the reference spreadsheet
`occurrences`:: How many times a `number_type` value is used in your data. Small numbers may indicate variant terms, typos, or number types that do not need an established controlled number type term in CS
`occs_with_remarks`:: How many occurrences of this `number_type` value have associated alt number `remarks`. If non-zero, and you choose `other_number` treatment, any data in this column will be dropped in the migration.
`occs_with_begindate`:: How many occurrences of this `number_type` value have associated alt number `beginisodate`. If non-zero, and you choose `other_number` treatment, any data in this column will be dropped in the migration.
`occs_with_enddate`:: How many occurrences of this `number_type` value have associated alt number `endisodate`. If non-zero, and you choose `other_number` treatment, any data in this column will be dropped in the migration.
`example_rec_nums`:: Up to 3 object numbers having the given `number_type`. Note that, if there are 100 occurrences, and 5 occs_with_remarks (or begin/end date occs), the example_rec_nums may or may not include records that have remarks data. You will need to filter the reference spreadsheet to the given `description` value and `remarks` (or begin/end date not empty) to see what remarks are made for the `number_type`
`example_values`:: Up to 3 `altnum` values for the given `number_type`. These should correspond to the records in `example_rec_nums`

The other columns are either editable (described below), or internal to the migration (can be ignored).

== Completing the worksheet

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only make changes to the following columns:

* `correct_type`
* `treatment`
* `note`

If you change values in `number_type`, we will not be able to merge your changes back into the migration.
====

=== `correct_type`

Use this column to standardize variant forms of number type terms, and fix typos:

.Will collapse four separate strings to one number type in CS
....
| number_type   | correct_type  |
|---------------+---------------|
| artist number | artist number |
| artists' #    | artist number |
| Artist number | artist number |
| Artist Number | artist number |
....

NOTE: If `treatment` value is `drop`, any information in this column is discarded.

=== `treatment`

Use this column to indicate the desired treatment for each type of number. See the data model differences section above, and the treatment examples below for further information.

The allowed values are:

* drop
* other_number
* numtyped_annotation
* annotation

=== `note`

Use this column to record specific information from the existing `number_type` value that should be treated as remarks instead.

NOTE: If `treatment` value is `drop` or `other_number`, any information in this column is discarded.

== Examples
Each example here shows you:

* Sample data from reference spreadsheet
* Relevant/related data as you might fill it out in the worksheet
* Resulting data for ingest to CS in CSV format (so we can see results affecting multiple records)

For screenshots of the CS record target fields, see the section on data model differences above.
