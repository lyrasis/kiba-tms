= Name type cleanup worksheet

toc::[]

== Purpose

This worksheet allows you to make sure names in your TMS data are migrated into the correct Person or Organization authorities in CollectionSpace (CS).

It also allows you to indicate names that should not be migrated and perform simple name corrections that can be merged into the next phase of name processing.

Finally, it may inform cleanup you want to do in TMS prior to migration.

[NOTE]
====
You may skip doing anything with this worksheet. Please let your migration specialist know if you want to skip this step.

If you perform no cleanup here, all names with a blank `authoritytype` value will migrate to CollectionSpace (CS) as Person authorities by default.

Let your migration specialist know if you want all names with a blank `authoritytype` value to be treated as Organizations
====

== Instructions

[WARNING]
====
*Do not add or delete any rows and do not edit any columns other than `correctname` and `correctauthoritytype`.*

If you edit other columns, those changes *_will not_* be merged into the migration. Editing some columns may prevent your allowed changes from being merged back into the migration. 
====

You may:
* Filter and sort the rows however you like
* Change the order of columns
* Add your own columns to support your work. Data in these will be ignored in the actual migration, but will be kept in any future iterations of the worksheet for your reference. Avoid using formulas or color coding/other formatting. These will be lost in future iterations of the worksheet, since all data is converted to plain text CSV format for processing.

== Suggested steps

=== Filter to `authoritytype` = (Blanks) and categorize the names

Follow the examples under https://github.com/lyrasis/kiba-tms/blob/main/doc/name_type_cleanup_worksheet.adoc#assign-authority-type[Procedures > Assign authority type].

=== Filter to `authoritytype` values that include `?` or `(derived)` and review

The `authoritytype` values with `?` were xref:data_preparation_details/deriving_authority_category_from_name_data.adoc[derived from name details] when no name type was explicitly assigned in TMS.

The `authoritytype` values with `(derived)` were derived from a TMS data row that was identified as representing more than one name.

The algorithms we used to derive these `authoritytypes` are not overly intelligent, so it is good to make sure these are right.

If the `?`/`derived` value is good, you don't need to do anything.

Otherwise, follow the examples under https://github.com/lyrasis/kiba-tms/blob/main/doc/name_type_cleanup_worksheet.adoc#correct-authority-type[Procedures > Correct authority type].

=== Sort by name and eyeball to find similar names that can be cleaned up via this worksheet

Refer to https://github.com/lyrasis/kiba-tms/blob/main/doc/name_type_cleanup_worksheet.adoc#cleaning-up-names[Procedures > Cleaning up names].

== Procedures

=== `correctauthoritytype` codes

`d`:: drop, or, do not migrate
`n`:: migrate as note instead of name
`o`:: Organization
`p`:: Person


=== Assign authority type

.Example 1, original
....
| name           | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Some Name Here |             |               |                      |
....

.Example 1 fixed, if "Some Name Here" is a Person
....
| name           | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Some Name Here |             |               | p                    |
....

.Example 1 fixed, if "Some Name Here" is an Organization
....
| name           | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Some Name Here |             |               | o                    |
....

=== Correct authority type

.Example 2, original
....
| name           | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Some Name Here |             | Person        |                      |
....

.Example 2, fixed, if "Some Name Here" is actually an Organization
....
| name           | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Some Name Here |             | Person        | o                    |
....

=== Indicate that a `name` value should migrate as note instead of a name

This worksheet contains all unique values in TMS fields that map to CS fields controlled by Person/Org authorities. Not all of those fields in TMS are controlled, so sometimes non-name information is recorded there.

.Example 3, original
....
| name                                        | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource                |
|---------------------------------------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+---------------------------|
| Already at Museum; picked up by Sam in 2012 |             |               |                      | TMS ObjIncoming.courierin |
....

In most cases, the records these values are mapping into have other fields we can populate with a free-text note. To indicate this treatment is desired for a value:

.Example 3, migrate as note
....
| name                                        | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource                |
|---------------------------------------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+---------------------------|
| Already at Museum; picked up by Sam in 2012 |             |               | n                    | TMS ObjIncoming.courierin |
....

=== Indicate that a `name` value should not migrate at all

.Example 4, original
....
| name        | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource               |
|-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+--------------------------|
| not entered |             |               |                      | TMS ObjIncoming.approver |
....

.Example 4, not migrating
....
| name        | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource               |
|-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+--------------------------|
| not entered |             |               | d                    | TMS ObjIncoming.approver |
....

No authority will be created for "not entered".

Fields that try to look up the migrating name (or note) value associated with this TMS value will just be left blank.

=== Cleaning up names

==== Merging multiple forms of name into one consistent form

.Example 5, original
....
| name                   | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource                  |
|------------------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+-----------------------------|
| Acquisition committee  |             | Organization  |                      | TMS ObjIncoming.approvedby  |
| Acquisitions committee |             | Organization  |                      | TMS ObjAccession.authorizer |
....

Left as is, the data will create two separate Organization authorities. You probably don't want that.

If you provide the following, one Organization for "Acquisitions committee" will be created.

The migration process will try to look up "Acquisition committee" and see that the proper name to use is "Acquisitions committee".

.Example 5, merging name forms with no variant
....
| name                   | correctname            | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource                  |
|------------------------+------------------------+---------------+----------------------+-----------------------------|
| Acquisition committee  | Acquisitions committee | Organization  |                      | TMS ObjIncoming.approvedby  |
| Acquisitions committee |                        | Organization  |                      | TMS ObjAccession.authorizer |
....

IMPORTANT: The solution above will *not* create a variant form of name "Acquisition committee" in the authority for "Acquisitions committee" (See https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace-migration-explainers/blob/main/docs/authority_main_variant_term_functionality.adoc[Authority main and variant term functionality]). This step is intended to handle simple/obvious misspellings/variations in form, without If creating a variant is important to you, wait until the next cleanup phase, which allows you to specify some more sophisticated operations. 


NOTE: If `authoritytype` needs to be added or corrected for the names, it needs to be done on each row!

.Example 6, original
....
| name                   | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource                  |
|------------------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+-----------------------------|
| Acquisition committee  |             |               |                      | TMS ObjIncoming.approvedby  |
| Acquisitions committee |             |               |                      | TMS ObjAccession.authorizer |
....

.Example 6, fixed
....
| name                   | correctname            | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource                  |
|------------------------+------------------------+---------------+----------------------+-----------------------------|
| Acquisition committee  | Acquisitions committee |               | o                    | TMS ObjIncoming.approvedby  |
| Acquisitions committee |                        |               | o                    | TMS ObjAccession.authorizer |
....

This is required because the following situation is possible:

.Example 7
....
| name     | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Vangard  | Vanguard    | Organization? | p                    |
| Vanguard |             | Organization  |                      |
....

In Example 7, the additional data provided for reference in the spreadsheet allowed you to determine the first is actually the name used by a person. Given the above, the migration will create one Organization authority for "Vanguard" and one Person authority for "Vanguard".

Another use case is if you have chosen direct form of name as your preferred form, but some names are entered in non-Constituent-linked fields in indirect order:

.Example 8, original
....
| name      | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource          |
|-----------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+---------------------|
| Jane Doe  |             | Person        |                      | Constituents.person |
| Doe, Jane |             |               |                      | Loans.requestedby   |
....

Given the above, if the second name is marked as a person without providing a `correctname`, two separate Person authorities will be created.

With the edits shown below, one Person authority is created for "Jane Doe" and that value will be used in your Loan In or Loan Out records.

.Example 8, fixed
....
| name      | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource          |
|-----------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+---------------------|
| Jane Doe  |             | Person        |                      | Constituents.person |
| Doe, Jane | Jane Doe    |               | p                    | Loans.requestedby   |
....

==== Correcting typos/errors in single names

This procedure can also be used to correct typos in single names:

.Example 9, original
....
| name        | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Brain Bones |             | Person        |                      |
....

This name may be used 100 times in your TMS data, but you only need to fix it once here for it to migrate with the correct spelling.

.Example 9, fixed
....
| name        | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Brain Bones | Brian Bones | Person        |                      |
....

==== Splitting multiple names in one field

Given the original data for Example 10, three separate Person authority records would be created.

.Example 10, original
....
| name                       | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Ann Booth                  |             | Person        |                      |
| Becky Barrow               |             | Person        |                      |
| Becky Barrow and Ann Booth |             | Person        |                      |
....

The fixed data for Example 10 below will cause two Person authority records to be created. For records in TMS that have "Becky Barrow and Ann Booth", the two name values will be entered separately:

image::name_type_cleanup_ex_10_1.png[1134]
+++&nbsp;+++

.Example 10, fixed
....
| name                       | correctname             | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------------------+-------------------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Ann Booth                  |                         | Person        |                      |
| Becky Barrow               | Beckie Barrow           | Person        |                      |
| Becky Barrow and Ann Booth | Beckie Barrow|Ann Booth | Person        | Person|Person        |
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note that:

* The corrected/final form of name must be given in the `correctname` column of the row being split. If we instead had `Becky Barrow|Ann Booth`, then three authorities will be created: Ann Booth, Beckie Barrow, and Becky Barrow.
* The authority type should be specified for each name in `correctauthoritytype`. This is required because you could have something like `Ann Booth|Vanguard`. Is that Vanguard the artist (Person), or the organization?
