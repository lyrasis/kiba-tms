= Name type cleanup worksheet

This page is about the name type review/cleanup worksheet provided to clients as Phase 1 of name cleanup.

For an overview of the name cleanup workflow, see: xref:name_cleanup_workflow_overview.adoc[Name cleanup workflow overview]

This worksheet allows you to:

* make sure names in your TMS data are migrated into the correct Person or Organization authorities in CollectionSpace (CS);
* indicate names that should not be migrated at all;
* indicate "name" values that should be treated as notes instead of names in the records where they are used; and
* perform simple name corrections that can be merged into the next phase of name processing

Finally, it may inform cleanup you wish to do in TMS prior to migration.

[NOTE]
====
You may skip doing anything with this worksheet. *Please let your migration specialist know if you want to skip this step.*

If you perform no cleanup here, a separate authority record will be created for each row in CS. All names with a blank `authoritytype` value will migrate to CollectionSpace (CS) as Person authorities by default.

*Let your migration specialist know if you want all names with a blank `authoritytype` value to be treated as Organizations.*

== Instructions

[WARNING]
====
*Do not add or delete any rows.*

*Do not edit any columns other than `correctname` and `correctauthoritytype`.*

If you edit other columns, those changes *_will not_* be merged into the migration. Editing some columns may prevent your allowed changes from being merged back into the migration.
====

You may:

* Filter and sort the rows however you like
* Change the order of columns
* Add your own columns to support your work. Data in these will be ignored in the actual migration, but will be kept in any future iterations of the worksheet for your reference.

CAUTION: Avoid using color coding/other formatting or formulas to indicate anything you wish to see in future iterations of the worksheet. The worksheet you return is converted to plain text CSV format for processing, so formatting and formulas are lost. Future iterations of the worksheet are produced as plain text CSV and imported into Excel.

== Suggested steps

=== If this is a subsequent round of name type cleanup

Filter to `to_review` = "y". This will show you only names that were not in the name type cleanup you already completed and returned.

You can also review other rows if you like, but they will have been included in a previous iteration of this worksheet.

=== Review `termsources`

Many name fields throughout the TMS database are populated by linking to an established Constituent value.

However, there are some name fields in TMS (for example `ObjAccession.authorizer`) that appear to be free text. In a default migration, these fields map to CS fields that are controlled by a name authority, so we have extracted values from these fields as names.

Your data entry practices have included regularly recording non-name info in any of these fields, then you may want to exclude that field across the board from being treated as a name in the migration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Opting to drop an entire termsource field or table is fairly rare, but has been requested in a few cases of really "free" data entry a client preferred to deal with post-migration.

If there are term sources where many of the values should be treated as names, but others shouldn't, you can indicate that per-row. You can instruct us to drop the value from the migration or treat it as a note. See the procedures section below for details.
====

.Steps
* Filter the `termsource` column to remove all sources beginning with `TMS Constituents` or `TMS ConAltNames` (the known controlled name sources in TMS).
* Sort on `termsource` column (and/or filter on one `termsource` value at a time)
* Eyeball the values from each source to determine if the values are primarily actual name data
* *Let your migration specialist know if you want any fields or tables removed from being treated as names in the migration*. They will regenerate your name type cleanup worksheet without values from the specified fields/tables.


NOTE: A `termsource` value like "TMS ObjIncoming.approver.handler" means the name value of the row appears in the approver and handler fields of the TMS ObjIncoming table.

=== Filter to `authoritytype` = (Blanks) and categorize the names

Follow the examples under https://github.com/lyrasis/kiba-tms/blob/main/doc/name_type_cleanup_worksheet.adoc#assign-authority-type[Procedures > Assign authority type].

=== Filter to `authoritytype` values that include `?` or `(derived)` and review

The `authoritytype` values with `?` were xref:data_preparation_details/deriving_authority_category_from_name_data.adoc[derived from name details] when no name type was explicitly assigned in TMS.

The `authoritytype` values with `(derived)` were derived from a TMS data row that was identified as representing more than one name.

The algorithms we used to derive these `authoritytypes` are not overly intelligent, so it is good to make sure these are right.

If the `?`/`derived` value is good, you don't need to do anything.

Otherwise, follow the examples under https://github.com/lyrasis/kiba-tms/blob/main/doc/name_type_cleanup_worksheet.adoc#correct-authority-type[Procedures > Correct authority type].

=== Sort by name and eyeball to find similar names that can be cleaned up via this worksheet

Refer to https://github.com/lyrasis/kiba-tms/blob/main/doc/name_type_cleanup_worksheet.adoc#cleaning-up-names[Procedures > Cleaning up names].

=== Indicate name values that should be dropped from migration or treated as notes

Refer to https://github.com/lyrasis/kiba-tms/blob/main/doc/name_type_cleanup_worksheet.adoc#cleaning-up-names[Procedures > Cleaning up names].

=== Handle other cleanup in TMS (or post-migration in CS)

More complex cleanup operations than those described in the Procedures section should be handled in TMS prior to migration, or cleaned up in CS after migration is complete. Some examples of things we can't handle programmatically via the migration process:


.Role/relationship term is not part of name
....
| name             | termsource            |
|------------------+-----------------------|
| Bob Allen        | TMS Constituents      |
| Bob Allen, donor | TMS Loans.requestedby |
....

Assuming Bob Allen as a donor is not a separate person from Bob Allen, there should only be one authority for him. If you need to retain the fact that he was the donor of objects he is now requesting loan of, that needs to be captured somewhere else in the Loan record:

image::name_type_cleanup_donor.png[2270]
+++&nbsp;+++

.Terms that make sense in a display, but not as a name value
....
| name   | termsource                |
|--------+---------------------------|
| artist | TMS ObjIncoming.courierin |
....

The above would create an authority for "artist" and all ObjIncoming records with courierin value "artist" would link to the same name, despite those artists being different people.

.Additional info in name
....
| name               | termsource        |
|--------------------+-------------------|
| Bob Allen          | TMS Constituents  |
| Bob Allen 555-1234 | TMS Loans.contact |
....

To avoid a second authority record being created for Bob, which includes his phone number as part of his name, move the phone number to Constituent information for Bob in TMS. If it is important to have the phone number in the loan record, move it to remarks.

Alternately, we migrate this as two separate Person names in CS, and you can later https://collectionspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COL/pages/905445377/User+Manual+Data+Updates+Merge+Authority+Items[merge them].

== Procedures

=== `correctauthoritytype` codes

`d`:: drop, or, do not migrate
`n`:: migrate as note instead of name
`o`:: Organization
`p`:: Person


=== Assign authority type

.Example 1, original
....
| name           | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Some Name Here |             |               |                      |
....

.Example 1 fixed, if "Some Name Here" is a Person
....
| name           | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Some Name Here |             |               | p                    |
....

.Example 1 fixed, if "Some Name Here" is an Organization
....
| name           | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Some Name Here |             |               | o                    |
....

=== Correct authority type

.Example 2, original
....
| name           | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Some Name Here |             | Person        |                      |
....

.Example 2, fixed, if "Some Name Here" is actually an Organization
....
| name           | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Some Name Here |             | Person        | o                    |
....

=== Indicate that a `name` value should migrate as note instead of a name

This worksheet contains all unique values in TMS fields that map to CS fields controlled by Person/Org authorities. Not all of those fields in TMS are controlled, so sometimes non-name information is recorded there.

.Example 3, original
....
| name                                        | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource                |
|---------------------------------------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+---------------------------|
| Already at Museum; picked up by Sam in 2012 |             |               |                      | TMS ObjIncoming.courierin |
....

In most cases, the records these values are mapping into have other fields we can populate with a free-text note. To indicate this treatment is desired for a value:

.Example 3, migrate as note
....
| name                                        | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource                |
|---------------------------------------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+---------------------------|
| Already at Museum; picked up by Sam in 2012 |             |               | n                    | TMS ObjIncoming.courierin |
....

=== Indicate that a `name` value should not migrate at all

.Example 4, original
....
| name        | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource               |
|-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+--------------------------|
| not entered |             |               |                      | TMS ObjIncoming.approver |
....

.Example 4, not migrating
....
| name        | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource               |
|-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+--------------------------|
| not entered |             |               | d                    | TMS ObjIncoming.approver |
....

No authority will be created for "not entered".

Fields that try to look up the migrating name (or note) value associated with this TMS value will just be left blank.

=== Cleaning up names

==== Merging multiple forms of name into one consistent form

.Example 5, original
....
| name                   | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource                  |
|------------------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+-----------------------------|
| Acquisition committee  |             | Organization  |                      | TMS ObjIncoming.approvedby  |
| Acquisitions committee |             | Organization  |                      | TMS ObjAccession.authorizer |
....

Left as is, the data will create two separate Organization authorities. You probably don't want that.

If you provide the following, one Organization for "Acquisitions committee" will be created.

The migration process will try to look up "Acquisition committee" and see that the proper name to use is "Acquisitions committee".

.Example 5, merging name forms with no variant
....
| name                   | correctname            | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource                  |
|------------------------+------------------------+---------------+----------------------+-----------------------------|
| Acquisition committee  | Acquisitions committee | Organization  |                      | TMS ObjIncoming.approvedby  |
| Acquisitions committee |                        | Organization  |                      | TMS ObjAccession.authorizer |
....

IMPORTANT: The solution above will *not* create a variant form of name "Acquisition committee" in the authority for "Acquisitions committee" (See https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace-migration-explainers/blob/main/docs/authority_main_variant_term_functionality.adoc[Authority main and variant term functionality]). This step is intended to handle simple/obvious misspellings/variations in form. If creating a variant is important to you, wait until the next cleanup phase, which allows you to specify some more sophisticated operations in terms of variant and related names.


NOTE: If `authoritytype` needs to be added or corrected for the names, it needs to be done on each row!

.Example 6, original
....
| name                   | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource                  |
|------------------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+-----------------------------|
| Acquisition committee  |             |               |                      | TMS ObjIncoming.approvedby  |
| Acquisitions committee |             |               |                      | TMS ObjAccession.authorizer |
....

.Example 6, fixed
....
| name                   | correctname            | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource                  |
|------------------------+------------------------+---------------+----------------------+-----------------------------|
| Acquisition committee  | Acquisitions committee |               | o                    | TMS ObjIncoming.approvedby  |
| Acquisitions committee |                        |               | o                    | TMS ObjAccession.authorizer |
....

This is required because the following situation is possible:

.Example 7
....
| name     | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Vangard  | Vanguard    | Organization? | p                    |
| Vanguard |             | Organization  |                      |
....

In Example 7, the additional data provided for reference in the spreadsheet allowed you to determine the first is actually the name used by a person. Given the above, the migration will create one Organization authority for "Vanguard" and one Person authority for "Vanguard".

Another use case is if you have chosen direct form of name as your preferred form, but some names are entered in non-Constituent-linked fields in indirect order:

.Example 8, original
....
| name      | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource          |
|-----------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+---------------------|
| Jane Doe  |             | Person        |                      | Constituents.person |
| Doe, Jane |             |               |                      | Loans.requestedby   |
....

Given the above, if the second name is marked as a person without providing a `correctname`, two separate Person authorities will be created.

With the edits shown below, one Person authority is created for "Jane Doe" and that value will be used in your Loan In or Loan Out records.

.Example 8, fixed
....
| name      | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype | termsource          |
|-----------+-------------+---------------+----------------------+---------------------|
| Jane Doe  |             | Person        |                      | Constituents.person |
| Doe, Jane | Jane Doe    |               | p                    | Loans.requestedby   |
....

==== Correcting typos/errors in single names

This procedure can also be used to correct typos in single names:

.Example 9, original
....
| name        | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Brain Bones |             | Person        |                      |
....

This name may be used 100 times in your TMS data, but you only need to fix it once here for it to migrate with the correct spelling.

.Example 9, fixed
....
| name        | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|-------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Brain Bones | Brian Bones | Person        |                      |
....

==== Splitting multiple names in one field

Given the original data for Example 10, three separate Person authority records would be created.

.Example 10, original
....
| name                       | correctname | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------------------+-------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Ann Booth                  |             | Person        |                      |
| Becky Barrow               |             | Person        |                      |
| Becky Barrow and Ann Booth |             | Person        |                      |
....

The fixed data for Example 10 below will cause two Person authority records to be created. For records in TMS that have "Becky Barrow and Ann Booth", the two name values will be entered separately:

image::name_type_cleanup_ex10_1.png[1134]
+++&nbsp;+++

.Example 10, fixed
....
| name                       | correctname             | authoritytype | correctauthoritytype |
|----------------------------+-------------------------+---------------+----------------------|
| Ann Booth                  |                         | Person        |                      |
| Becky Barrow               | Beckie Barrow           | Person        |                      |
| Becky Barrow and Ann Booth | Beckie Barrow|Ann Booth | Person        | p|p                  |
....

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note that:

* The corrected/final form of name must be given in the `correctname` column of the row being split. If we instead had `Becky Barrow|Ann Booth`, then three authorities will be created: Ann Booth, Beckie Barrow, and Becky Barrow.
* The authority type should be specified for each name in `correctauthoritytype`. This is required because you could have something like `Ann Booth|Vanguard`. Is that Vanguard the artist (Person), or the organization?
