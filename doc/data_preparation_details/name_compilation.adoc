= Name compilation details

This page describes how your TMS data is transformed and compiled to create the `names_compiled_unique.csv` file described in xref:../name_cleanup_workflow_overview.adoc[Name cleanup workflow overview]

toc::[]

== Name source tables

=== Included by default
If client has no data in a table, it is excluded.

Tables involving complex data preparation link to their own details pages.

The names are compiled in this order. When deduplication is done later, the first value is kept. This ensures names from the Constituent table are kept, which is important since linkages/references to Constituent values are made from many other tables. 

* xref:constituents.adoc[Constituents table]
* xref:con_alt_names.adoc[ConAltNames table]
* AssocParents table
** keep only rows related to Constituents
** keep unique `childstring` field values
** not categorized as Person/Organization
** treat as main term
* Loans table
** keep unique `approvedby`, `contact`, and `requestedby` field values
** not categorized as Person/Organization
** treat as main term
* LocApprovers table
** keep unique `approver` field values
** not categorized as Person/Organization
** treat as main term
* LocHandlers table
** keep unique `handler` field values
** not categorized as Person/Organization
** treat as main term
* ObjAccession table
** keep unique `authorizer` and `initiator` field values
** not categorized as Person/Organization
** treat as main term
* ObjIncoming table
** keep unique `approvedby`, `requestedby`, `courierin`, `courierout`, `cratepaidby`, `ininsurpaidby`, and `shippingpaidby` field values
** not categorized as Person/Organization
** treat as main term
* ObjLocations table
** keep unique `approver`, `handler`, and `requestedby` field values
** not categorized as Person/Organization
** treat as main term

=== Not included by default

* ReferenceMaster table
** it is assumed that the controlled names used in references will be merged in via references to constituents, however there is name data in a more free text form included in the `stmtresponsibility` field of this table. Because it would require significantly more cleanup to make it appropriate for use as Person/Org authority terms, it is not included by default.
** keep unique `stmtresponsibility` field values
** not categorized as Person/Organization
** treat as main term

== Deduplication

For different categories, certain field values are combined and the unique values are kept for review/cleanup.

main terms:: only one row having the same `authority type + normalized form of name` value is kept
variant terms:: under each `authority type + main term (normalized)`, only one row having the same `variant term (not normalized) + variant_qualifier` value is kept
related terms:: under each `authority type + main term (normalized)`, only one row having the same `relation_type + related term (not normalized) + related_role` value is kept
notes:: under each `authority type + main term (normalized)`, only one row having the same `relation_type + note_text` value is kept

Rows where the authority type is unknown and the normalized form of name matches a normalized form of name for a known authority type are also removed.

== Organization of the spreadsheet

== What you see in the spreadsheet and how it translates to CS

=== Organizations

==== Main term only, with dates

.Spreadsheet data

+++&nbsp;+++

.Resulting organization authority
image::org_plain_w_dates_r.png[2098]
+++&nbsp;+++

==== Variant terms

.Spreadsheet data

+++&nbsp;+++

==== Related organizations

.Spreadsheet data
image::org_rel_note_d.png[2098]
+++&nbsp;+++

Since these are two separate, but related organizations, two Organization authority records are created.

Since CS does not currently provide a way to relate two authority terms in anything but a hierarchical relationship, the fact that there is another related name is recorded in a note.

.Resulting organization authority (1)
image::org_rel_note_r1.png[2058]
+++&nbsp;+++

.Resulting organization authority (2)
image::org_rel_note_r2.png[2058]
+++&nbsp;+++

NOTE: We have not yet run across TMS data that was structured such that we could create Organizational hierarchies by creating hierarchical relationships between authority terms in CS. We do sometimes see super/sub bodies recorded as variant or related names, and those will be handled according to how the given client has coded them in TMS. The client will be free to create hierarchical relationship between Organization names once in production, if they wish.

Handling related terms this way means:

* Since both terms contain "Getty" they both come up as options for populated fields in other records if we enter that string, and we can choose the correct one:

.Both terms as options when populating a field

+++&nbsp;+++

* Since the name of each appears in the record of the other, a simple/keyword search for one returns both:

.Keyword search
image::org_rel_note_s1.png[2058]
+++&nbsp;+++

* If you do an advanced search you can search for the name only in the _Display name_ field of a record

.Advanced search on _Display name_: query

.Advanced search on _Display name_: results

==== Organization with contact person

image::org_cp_d_o.png[1442]
+++&nbsp;+++

.Spreadsheet data (person)
image::org_cp_d_p.png[2226]
+++&nbsp;+++

Two person authority records are created to represent the contact persons. Then the organization record records those persons and, if present, indication of their role/relationship to the organization.

=== Persons
==== With variants, birth/death dates, and related person names

.Spreadsheet data
image::per_brassai_d.png[2660]
+++&nbsp;+++

This data creates 3 Person authorities. Brassa誰 has two variant names, as well as two related people:

== More technical details
=== `constituentid` values

==== Plain number (ex: 1611)

If `relation_type` = main term, the `name` value in the row came from the preferred name field in the Constituent record with that id.

If `relation_type` = variant_term, the `variant_term` value in the row came from the preferred name field in Constituent record with that id. The id of the constituent row from which the `name` value is derived is not represented. This row is added because, after normalization, the preferred name values of these two constituents are duplicates, though there are minor differences in the un-normalized values.

==== Number + . + institution (ex: 8775.institution)

If `relation_type` = main term, the `name` value in the row came from the `institution` field in the record with the given constituent id (8775).

If `relation_type` = contact_person, the `name` value in the row came from the `institution` field in the record with the given constituent id (8775). The `related_term` value is the preferred name from the given constituent record (8775).

If `relation_type` = variant_term, the `variant_term` value in the row came from the `institution` field in the record with the given constituent id (8775). The `name` value in the row comes from the preferred name field of the given constituent id (8775).


==== Number + . + position (ex: 8775.position)

If `relation_type` = bio_note, the `note_text` value in the row came from the `position` field in the record with the given constituent id (8775). The `name` value in the row comes from the preferred name field of the given constituent id (8775).

==== Number + . + namedetail (ex: 8775.namedetail)

Name detail fields include `firstname`, `middlename`, `lastname`, etc.

If `relation_type` = main term, the `name` value in the row came from the name detail fields in the record with the given constituent id (8775).

If `relation_type` = contact_person, the `name` value in the row is the preferred name from the given constituent record (8775). The `related_term` value came from the name detail fields in the record with the given constituent id (8775).

==== Number + . + number (ex: 11.514)

altnameid (from ConAltNames table) . constituentid (from Constituents table, i.e. main name of which the alt name is a variant)

See documentation on term sources for details on how rows are derived.

==== Number + . + number + . + number (ex: 12.527.530)

altnameid (from ConAltNames table) . constituentid (from Constituents table, i.e. main name of which the alt name is a variant) . constituent id of main name that, when normalized, matches the alt name value.

See documentation on term sources for details on how rows are derived.

==== Table name + . + name string (ex: Loans.Jon T. Wilson)

Table (having name fields not linked to constituent ids) from which name was extracted, and the original name value.
