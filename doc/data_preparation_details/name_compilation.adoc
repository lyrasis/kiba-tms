= Name compilation details

This document explains how your TMS Constituents (and other name data) has been programmatically prepared for migration into CollectionSpace (CS), and options you have for changing how this has been handled.

NOTE: This documentation covers TMS migrations in general, so may discuss data patterns not present in your data.

toc::[]

== Basic differences/assumptions to be aware of
=== Conceptual/data model differences
Your Contituent (and other) names will migrate into Person and Organization authorities in CS. The conceptual/data model for Constituents in TMS is very different from (and more complex than) the conceptual/data model for Person and Organization authorities. *We strongly recommend you log into your staging instance site and familiarize yourself with Person and Organization records*.

See also https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace-migration-explainers/blob/main/docs/authority_main_variant_term_functionality.adoc[Authority main and variant term functionality] documentation.

In CS, the Person/Org authorities are used to ensure the consistency of names used in other records. Some additional information about a person or organization may be stored in the authority record for a name, but the fields available are less granular than in TMS.

TMS builds a lot of functionality/behavior onto constituents (which is a more complex concept than "names") that isn't really supported in CS. 

=== Categorization to Person vs. Organization authorities
Ideally, all constituent names and names from other sources are categorized as either Person or Organization for migration into CS authorities.

If a given client has many uncategorized names in TMS and cannot assign them to Person or Organization prior to the migration, they can specify that all uncategorized names should be created as either Person or Organization records in CS. We can set a term status flag in these records so they may be identified in CS for post-migration review.

== Name sources

=== Included by default
If client has no data in a table, it is excluded.

Tables involving complex data preparation link to their own details pages.

The names are compiled in this order. When deduplication is done later, the first value is kept. This ensures names from the Constituent table are kept, which is important since linkages/references to Constituent values are made from many other tables. 

* xref:constituents.adoc[Constituents table]
* xref:con_alt_names.adoc[ConAltNames table]
* AssocParents table
** keep only rows related to Constituents
** keep unique `childstring` field values
** categorized as Person names
** treat as main term
* Loans table
** keep unique `approvedby`, `contact`, and `requestedby` field values
** not categorized as Person/Organization
** treat as main term
* LocApprovers table
** keep unique `approver` field values
** categorized as Person names
** treat as main term
* LocHandlers table
** keep unique `handler` field values

** not categorized as Person/Organization
** treat as main term
* ObjLocations table
** keep unique `approver`, `handler`, and `requestedby` field values
** not categorized as Person/Organization

=== Not included by default

* ReferenceMaster table
** it is assumed that the controlled names used in references will be merged in via references to constituents, however there is name data in a more free text form included in the `stmtresponsibility` field of this table. Because it would require significantly more cleanup to make it appropriate for use as Person/Org authority terms, it is not included by default.
** keep unique `stmtresponsibility` field values
** not categorized as Person/Organization
** treat as main term

== Deduplication

For different categories, certain field values are combined and the unique values are kept for review/cleanup.

main terms:: only one row having the same `authority type + normalized form of name` value is kept
variant terms:: under each `authority type + main term (normalized)`, only one row having the same `variant term (not normalized) + variant_qualifier` value is kept
related terms:: under each `authority type + main term (normalized)`, only one row having the same `relation_type + related term (not normalized) + related_role` value is kept
notes:: under each `authority type + main term (normalized)`, only one row having the same `relation_type + note_text` value is kept

Rows where the authority type is unknown and the normalized form of name matches a normalized form of name for a known authority type are also removed.

== Organization of the spreadsheet

== What you see in the spreadsheet and how it translates to CS

=== Organizations

==== Main term only, with dates

.Spreadsheet data

+++&nbsp;+++

.Resulting organization authority

+++&nbsp;+++

==== Variant terms

+++&nbsp;+++

==== Related organizations

.Spreadsheet data
image::org_rel_note_d.png[2098]
+++&nbsp;+++

Since these are two separate, but related organizations, two Organization authority records are created.

Since CS does not currently provide a way to relate two authority terms in anything but a hierarchical relationship, the fact that there is another related name is recorded in a note.

.Resulting organization authority (1)
image::org_rel_note_r1.png[2058]
+++&nbsp;+++

.Resulting organization authority (2)
image::org_rel_note_r2.png[2058]
+++&nbsp;+++

NOTE: We have not yet run across TMS data that was structured such that we could create Organizational hierarchies by creating hierarchical relationships between authority terms in CS. We do sometimes see super/sub bodies recorded as variant or related names, and those will be handled according to how the given client has coded them in TMS. The client will be free to create hierarchical relationship between Organization names once in production, if they wish.

Handling related terms this way means:

* Since both terms contain "Getty" they both come up as options for populated fields in other records if we enter that string, and we can choose the correct one:

.Both terms as options when populating a field
image::org_rel_note_u.png[626]
+++&nbsp;+++

* Since the name of each appears in the record of the other, a simple/keyword search for one returns both:

.Keyword search
image::org_rel_note_s1.png[2058]
+++&nbsp;+++

* If you do an advanced search you can search for the name only in the _Display name_ field of a record

.Advanced search on _Display name_: query
image::org_rel_note_s2.png[1506]
+++&nbsp;+++

.Advanced search on _Display name_: results

==== Organization with contact person

.Spreadsheet data (org)
image::org_cp_d_o.png[1442]
+++&nbsp;+++

.Spreadsheet data (person)
image::org_cp_d_p.png[2226]
+++&nbsp;+++

Two person authority records are created to represent the contact persons. Then the organization record records those persons and, if present, indication of their role/relationship to the organization.

=== Persons
==== With variants, birth/death dates, and related person names

.Spreadsheet data
image::per_brassai_d.png[2660]
+++&nbsp;+++

This data creates 3 Person authorities. Brassa誰 has two variant names, as well as two related people:

.Person authority: Brassa誰 (continued)

.Person authority: Gilberte-Mercedes Brassa誰

== More technical details
=== `constituentid` values

==== Plain number (ex: 1611)

If `relation_type` = main term, the `name` value in the row came from the main/primary name in Constituent record with that id.

If `relation_type` = variant_term, the `variant_term` value in the row came from the main/primary name in Constituent record with that id.

==== Number + . + text (ex: 8775.insitution)
