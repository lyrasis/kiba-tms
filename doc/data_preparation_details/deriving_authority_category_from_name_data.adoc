= Deriving authority category from name data

This algorithm uses name details to make a "best guess" at whether a name is a Person or an Organization.

The client is asked to review and correct this information.

Person field(s):: `lastname`, `firstname`
Org field(s):: `institution`

The OrgNameChecker checks whether a preferred name matches any of https://github.com/lyrasis/kiba-tms/blob/main/lib/kiba/tms/services/names/org_name_checker.rb[the specified patterns that indicate "organization-ness"]. It returns true if a name matches any organization patterns, and false if not.

* If person field(s) are not populated AND org field(s) are not populated
** Derived type = Organization if OrgNameChecker returns true
** No derived type if OrgNameChecker returns false
* If both person and org field(s) are populated
** Derived type = Organization if OrgNameChecker returns true
** No derived type if OrgNameChecker returns false
* If person field(s) are populated and org field(s) are not
** Derived type = Person
* If org field(s) are populated and person field(s) are not
** Derived type = Organization
